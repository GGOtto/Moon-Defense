# Moon-Defense
You'll need pygame to play. 

How to play:
- Your goal is to destroy as many rockets as possible before a rocket comes all the way to your level.
- You can destroy a rocket by bouncing one of the meteors off of yourself at that rocket.
- You can move using the cursor.
- The meteors, if missed, will leave craters. If there are too many craters in one spot, you cannot cross them without hovering.
- If the battery in the upper-right corner is full, you can hover using spacebar.

Have fun!
